### Universal Time
Coordinated Universal Time or Universal Time Coordinated (internationally abbreviated as UTC) is the primary time
standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is often interchanged or confused with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). But GMT is a time zone
and UTC is a time standard. Although GMT and UTC share the same current time in practice, there is a basic difference
between the two:

#### GMT
GMT is a time zone officially used in some European and African countries. The time can be displayed using both the
24-hour format (0 - 24) or the 12-hour format (1 - 12 am/pm).

#### UTC 
UTC is not a time zone, but a time standard that is the basis for civil time and time zones worldwide. This means that
no country or territory officially uses UTC as a local time. Another commonly used name for UTC is Z time (or Zulu time)
which is used in airplane and ship navigation.

The time zone containing London establishes the reference (UTC or UTC+0) as it is where the Greenwich meridian is located,
or meridian 0º, which is the central meridian of the time zone.
To obtain your local time here in Brazil, you need to subtract a certain number of hours from UTC depending on how many
time zones you are away from Greenwich (England).
For example: In relation to Brasilia time, UTC is three hours ahead. This is: 00:27 in Brasilia → 03:27 in UTC standard.
